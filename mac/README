COCOA WEB APP EXAMPLE

This is an example Cocoa application which displays an HTML page in a WebView. It demonstrates how to communicate between Objective-C and JavaScript through the WebScriptObject. If you have a web app which could benefit from desktop integration, I highly recommend creating a Cocoa app which interacts with it.

To try it out, open the "Cocoa Web App.xcodeproj" file in Xcode and click "Build and Run". See the code in "AppDelegate.m" and "index.html" to see how it works.

	git clone git://github.com/ryanb/cocoa-web-app-example.git
	open cocoa-web-app-example/Cocoa\ Web\ App.xcodeproj
